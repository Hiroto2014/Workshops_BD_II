## Project Sections

1. **Concurrency Analysis** (Page 1–2)  
   Describes critical scenarios of concurrent access such as lost updates, race conditions, and phantom reads, along with their solutions using locking mechanisms and isolation levels.

2. **Distributed Database Design** (Page 2–3)  
   Outlines the hybrid architecture of the system using PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis. Defines the distributed model segmented by geographic regions (Colombia, USA, Europe) to ensure scalability, high availability, and data compliance.

3. **Mechanisms** (Page 3)  
   Explains the specific technical strategies implemented for regional sharding, replication sets, hash slot distribution, and inter-region data synchronization.

4. **Performance Improvement Strategies** (Page 4)  
   Proposes three strategies to optimize system performance: horizontal partitioning (sharding), replication for high availability, and parallel query execution. Each strategy includes advantages and trade-offs.
